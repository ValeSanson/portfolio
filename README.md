# Portfolio of Valentina Sanson
A showcase of the projects I worked on or contributed to throughout my university studies.

# Project 1: 

**Description:**  
This project focuses on a multi-label classification task using a dataset composed of short children's stories, each annotated with zero or more tags. The goal is to automatically assign the appropriate tags to each story based on its content. It consists of solving six binary classification problems, and the aim is to develop and compare two different models to perform this task. The first model is a pre-trained language model called RoBERTa, an improved version of BERT developed by Facebook AI (Meta AI), while the second model is a convolutional neural network (CNN). By comparing these two architectures — a state-of-the-art transformer and a custom-built CNN — the project explores the trade-offs between modern pre-trained models and simpler, more lightweight alternatives for text classification tasks.

💻 Technologies: Python, PyTorch, NumPy, Scikit-Learn.

For a more theoretical perspective, I have also included my Bachelor's thesis.<br>
This thesis introduces the concept of Lie algebras, with a particular focus on semisimple and solvable Lie algebras of finite dimension over an algebraically closed field of characteristic 0. Several fundamental theorems are proven, including Lie's Theorem, Cartan's Criterion, and Levi's Theorem, whose main consequences and applications are studied. Each result is illustrated with examples and counterexamples.

# Machine Learning Coursework Projects:

**Description:**
- Built transformer-based GPT-2 and character-level language models for text generation; applied cross-entropy loss, perplexity evaluation, and sampling techniques.
- Implemented reinforcement learning (Q-learning) in Gymnasium environments.
- Built a trigram language model to compute n-gram probabilities and generate new poetic sequences. (Python)
