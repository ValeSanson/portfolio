# Portfolio of Valentina Sanson
A showcase of the projects I worked on or contributed to throughout my university studies.

# Project 1 (Machine Learning final project): 

**Description:**  
This project focuses on a multi-label classification task using a dataset composed of short children's stories, each annotated with zero or more tags. The goal is to automatically assign the appropriate tags to each story based on its content. It consists of solving six binary classification problems, and the aim is to develop and compare two different models to perform this task. The first model is a pre-trained language model called RoBERTa, an improved version of BERT developed by Facebook AI (Meta AI), while the second model is a convolutional neural network (CNN). By comparing these two architectures — a state-of-the-art transformer and a custom-built CNN — the project explores the trade-offs between modern pre-trained models and simpler, more lightweight alternatives for text classification tasks.

# Project 2 (Matlab buit-in solvers bvp4c and bvp5c):

**Description:** <br>
In this project, we explore boundary value problems (BVPs), starting with their theoretical foundations and then examining their practical applications. We focus on the theoretical foundations and the numerical solutions of BVPs, with particular attention to collocation-based techniques. We will investigate two built-in MATLAB solvers based on Lobatto IIIa formula of different orders - bvp4c and bvp5c - to understand how they work, compare their main differences and identify the scenarios in which each solver is most appropriate. To supplement the theoretical analysis, we developed a graphical user interface (GUI) in MATLAB App Designer that enables the user to experiment interactively with several examples of BVPs. The examples implemented in the app are derived from the paper by Shampine, Reichelt, and Kierzenka (2000), "Solving Boundary Value Problems for Ordinary Differential Equations in MATLAB with bvp4c".

# Mathematical and Machine Learning Methods in Imaging Coursework Project:

**Description:**
Implemented a Deep Learning framework in PyTorch to address a Image Inverse Problem (e.g. Image Reconstruction/Denoising) leveraging the specialized deepinv library, and evaluating performance improvements through quantitative metrics like PSNR and SSIM.

# Thesis:

**Description:**

For a more theoretical perspective, I have also included my Bachelor's thesis.<br>
This thesis introduces the concept of Lie algebras, with a particular focus on semisimple and solvable Lie algebras of finite dimension over an algebraically closed field of characteristic 0. Several fundamental theorems are proven, including Lie's Theorem, Cartan's Criterion, and Levi's Theorem, whose main consequences and applications are studied. Each result is illustrated with examples and counterexamples.
